,,Reduce scale of the EC2,,,,Due to the fact that cost of ec2 and rds took the most of the budget so reduce the scale for both of the service would be an ideal decision,,,,,,,This will reduced the performace of the server,,,,,,
,,Reduce scale of the RDS,,,,,,,,,,,This will reduced the performace of the database,,,,,,
